# The Lexicon der indogermanischen Verben (LIV)
“The Lexicon der indogermanischen Verben (LIV) is an etymological dictionary of verbs attested in ancient Indo-European languages, published in 2001 by Helmut Rix. It contains information regarding reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verbal roots, reconstructed PIE verbal stems and word forms historically attested in ancient IE languages. The Latin word forms listed in the dictionary are 550. The publisher of the dictionary allowed us to model and publish the etymological relations between PIE roots, stems and Latin word forms contained in the data.”
